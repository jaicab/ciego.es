#[Ciego.es](http://ciego.es)

Ciego is a search engine for cheap places to get drunk. It started as a joke between friends and now it's a nice **AngularJS** and **Google Maps v3 API** experiment developed entirely from scratch.

> "Ciego" means blind in spanish. In this context, it means "blind drunk".

It's hosted on GitHub Pages and uses a simple API hosted in my server to manage the data. The `master` branch is used for a development version while the `gh-pages` hosts the live version.
